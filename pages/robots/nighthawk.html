		<th>How we addressed the challenge:</th>
		<td>For the fifth consecutive year, we used our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecanum_wheel">mecanum</a> wheel system as our drivetrain.  To pick up and stack the totes and garbage bins, Nighthawk had two pneumatic powered claws, one on the top of the robot and the other on the bottom.  The bottom claw was attached to a metal column that allowed vertical movement.  The top claw was useful in holding the trash bin in place while the totes were being stacked.  With the two claws and its tall height, Nighthawk was able to successfully stack 6 totes and a trash bin on top of it, maximizing the potential points in game.</td>

		<th>Results:</th>
		<td>Nighthawk was able to successfully stack 6 totes with a bin on top in several competitions, but often had a difficult time if it or the totes were even slightly misaligned.  Originally, it also had a problem with tipping due to its uneven weight distribution, with was later fixed with the addition of a back wheel.</td>
